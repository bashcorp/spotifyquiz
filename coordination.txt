Homepage:   /
Dashboard:  /dashboard/
Quiz:       /quiz/<quiz_id>/
Results:    /results/           (a user be taken to this screen after hitting
                                 submit, which will provide them their own
                                 results. I guess if you just go to this page
                                 without having just taken a quiz, that would
                                 show them nothing? Let's talk about this)
