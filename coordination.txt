Homepage:   /
Dashboard:  /dashboard/
Quiz:       /quiz/<quiz_id>/
Results:    /results/           (a user be taken to this screen after hitting
                                 submit, which will provide them their own
                                 results. I guess if you just go to this page
                                 without having just taken a quiz, that would
                                 show them nothing? Let's talk about this)



------Passing data through a URL request------
When the user goes to a url, let's say "website.com/quiz/<quiz_uuid>", a
request goes to the server. The server has to respond to that request with an
HTML page. But Django also gives me the option to include JSON data along with
that HTML page. So it would be great, when you go to /quiz/<quiz_uuid>, if the
server could just pass the quiz data along with the HTML page.

There is a way to do this, but the issue is, the data is only passed along
when Django renders whatever HTML it has on the server (which is
'public/index.html'). All of React's "html" is really Javascript, which
apparently means its rendered on the browser, not on the server.

So normally, you could grab that quiz data right from the Quiz HTML page. But
because you're using react, it's not as simple. You need to grab it from the
HTML file that is rendered on the server (public.html) and then store it so you
can use it later in your React code.

I haven't tried this, though. So maybe I'm totally wrong
